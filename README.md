Please refer to the [Conway's Game of Life Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life") to see what this is all about. There is a lot to it, and it has interesting implications to evolution, biological life, and mathematics. But... simply visit [https://sarbajitsaha.github.io/Conway-s-Game-Of-Life/](https://sarbajitsaha.github.io/Conway-s-Game-Of-Life/), click on 'Randomise' and 'Start' to begin the simulation.

Some patterns do more interesting things than others. The wikipedia page will tell you about them if you don't want to hunt.
